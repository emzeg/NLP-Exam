Innocent VIII: BULL Summis desiderantes, Dec. 5th, 1484
 Bullarium Romanum (Taurinensis editio),
 Innocent, bishop, servant of the servants of God, Ad futuram rei memoriam
 Desiring with supreme ardor, as pastoral solicitude requires, that the catholic faith in our days
 everywhere grow and flourish as much as possible, and that all heretical depravity be put far from the
 territories of the faithful, we freely declare and anew decree this by which our pious desire may be
 fulfilled, and, all errors being rooted out by our toil as with the hoe of a wise laborer, zeal and devotion
 to this faith may take deeper hold on the hearts of the faithful themselves.
 It has recently come to our ears, not without great pain to us, that in some parts of upper Germany, as
 well as in the provinces, cities, territories, regions, and dioceses of Mainz, Ko1n, Trier, Salzburg, and
 Bremen, many persons of both sexes, heedless of their own salvation and forsaking the catholic faith,
 give themselves over to devils male and female, and by their incantations, charms, and conjurings, and
 by other abominable superstitions and sortileges, offences, crimes, and misdeeds, ruin and cause to
 perish the offspring of women, the foal of animals, the products of the earth, the grapes of vines, and
 the fruits of trees, as well as men and women, cattle and flocks and herds and animals of every kind,
 vineyards also and orchards, meadows, pastures, harvests, grains and other fruits of the earth; that
 they afflict and torture with dire pains and anguish, both internal and external, these men, women,
 cattle, flocks, herds, and animals, and hinder men from begetting and women from conceiving, and
 prevent all consummation of marriage; that, moreover, they deny with sacrilegious lips the faith they .
 received in holy baptism; and that, at the instigation of the enemy of mankind, they do not fear to
 commit and perpetrate many other abominable offences and crimes, at the risk of their own souls, to
 the insult of the divine majesty and to the pernicious example and scandal of multitudes. And, although
 our beloved sons Henricus Institoris and Jacobus Sprenger, of the order of Friars Preachers, professors of theology, have been and still are deputed by our apostolic letters as inquisitors of heretical pravity,
 the former in the aforesaid parts of upper Germany, including the provinces, cities, territories, dioceses,
 and other places as above, and the latter throughout certain parts of the course of the Rhine;
 nevertheless certain of the clergy and of the laity of those parts, seeking to be wise above what is
 fitting, because in the said letter of deputation the aforesaid provinces, cities, dioceses, territories, and
 other places, and the persons and offences in question were not individually and specifically named, do
 not blush obstinately to assert that these are not at all included in the said parts and that therefore it is
 illicit for the aforesaid inquisitors to exercise their office of inquisition in the provinces, cities, dioceses,
 territories, and other places aforesaid, and that they ought not to be permitted to proceed to the
 punishment, imprisonment, and correction of the aforesaid persons for the offences and crimes above
 named. Wherefore in the provinces, cities, dioceses territories, and places aforesaid such offences and
 crimes, not without evident damage to their souls and risk of eternal salvation, go unpunished.
 We therefore, desiring, as is our duty, to remove all impediments by which in any way the said
 inquisitors are hindered in the exercise of their office, and to prevent the taint of heretical pravity and
 of other like evils from spreading their infection to the ruin of others who are innocent, the zeal of
 religion especially impelling us, in order that the provinces, cities, dioceses, territories, and places
 aforesaid in the said parts of upper Germany may not be deprived of the office of inquisition which is
 their due, do hereby decree, by virtue of our apostolic authority, that it shall be permitted to the said
 inquisitors in these regions to exercise their office of inquisition and to proceed to the correction,
 imprisonment, and punishment of the aforesaid persons for their said offences and crimes, in all
 respects and altogether precisely as if the provinces, cities, territories, places, persons, and offences
 aforesaid were expressly named in the said letter. And, for the greater sureness, extending the said
 letter and deputation to the provinces, cities, dioceses, territories, places, persons, and crimes
 aforesaid, we grant to the said inquisitors that they or either of them joining with them our beloved son
 Johannes Gremper, cleric of the diocese of Coonstance, master of arts, their present notary, or any
 other notary public who by them or by either of them shall have been temporarily delegated in the
 provinces, cities, dioceses, territories, and places aforesaid, may exercise against all persons, of
 whatsoever condition and rank, the said office of inquisition, correcting, imprisoning, punishing and
 chastising, according to their deserts, those persons whom they shall find guilty as aforesaid.
 And they shall also have full and entire liberty to propound and preach to the faithful word of God, as
 often as it shall seem to them fitting and proper, in each and all of the parish churches in the said
 provinces, and to do all things necessary and suitable under the aforesaid circumstances, and likewise
 freely and fully to carry them out.
